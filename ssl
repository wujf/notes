Install CA certificates on Ubuntu:

1. copy .crt to /usr/share/ca-certificates/extra
2. run 'dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates' or 'update-ca-certificates'

/etc/ca-certificates.conf

Still not work in firefox and chrome
Firefox: preferences/avdanced/view certificates/
Chrome: settings/manage ssl/tls certificates
